#Galemastery is an Air Magic-spell built around resource management.
#When the spell is active the user is able to collect it's resource called SkyParticles.
#These skyparticles are required to cast additional spells built into a buff through passives.
#Resource based spells are more realistic since they lessen the reliance on cooldowns.
#The use of skyparticles ensures that the user of this ability needs to interact with their element (in this case air) in order to gain the resource needed to cast their spells.
#In the spell below you will see how to set up a spell as such.
#The resource for this spell can be gained by gliding (as an air mage should), or falling which happens a lot since air related spells often include leaps.


variables:
    SkyParticles: #name of the variable (could be anything)
        type: player #Variable is bound to a specific player
        permanent: false #Variable value resets after a server reload/restart
        default: 45 #default starting value after reload/restart (because for this spell movement is essential to Air Spells the default is deliberately placed at 40 so that players in a particular situation always have some skyparticles available to spend after a reload.
        min: 0 #Minimum amount of skyparticles a single player can have (basically if they spent all of it.
        max: 100 #Maximum amount of spyparticles a single player can have.
#Min,Max and Default value for particles are all dependant on the use case. See this specific variable as a currency. Other spells below require skyparticles in order to activate them. If the max is too low it limits their use case, if it's too high they don't have to really think about managing their particles.

#Quick Explenation:
# 1 tick = 1/20 of a second so it is 0.05 seconds.
# when falling you gain 0.5 skyparticles every 3 ticks or 0.15 seconds
# to calculate the amount of times we need to gain 0.5 skyparticles to reach 100 we do 100/0.5 = 200 (we need fallmilescast to trigger 200x for the user to go from 0 to 100 particles)
# if we multiply this 200 with 3 (amount of time it takes to cast fallmilescast once) we get 600 ticks
# So the user needs to fall for 600 ticks or 600x0.05seconds = 30 seconds - after half a minute of falling you could ammulate 100 skyparticles
