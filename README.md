# MagicSpellsLibrary
The MS Library is meant to be a reference for  spell templates and explenation of parameters.
These will focus primarily on slightly more tricky spell aspects like equations and variables for those unfamiliar.
Slowly this will expand to include more basic concepts so that in the end even a beginner can make so-desured ability.


Quick Explenation

What is a variable ?
- A variable is quite literally everything that doesn't have a constant value.
But it's invisible unless you make it visible, in essence it's storage but for all sorts of in-game data instead of items.
What does that mean ? It's a way to keep track/summon things that.. well.. vary.

In order to add variety to your abilities you can make use of said variables to:
- Change casting requirements 
- empower abilities based on ... (fill the blanks yourself)
- In the file you will find examples of spells that make use of these variables in order to achieve the desired outcome I had in mind.


What's an equation-effect?
Equations leverage the use of mathematical equations to get particles to move in a specific pattern.
If used properly this will probably give you the greatest flexibility and range of motion of any particle effect.

In return it's probably one of the most complex ones since you can't necesarily tell what it looks like from the configuration.
But we can bring some clarity using some tools.

WolframAlpha has a tool that allows you to visualise these equations.
